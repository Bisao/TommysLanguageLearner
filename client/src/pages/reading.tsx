At school, I met my teacher, Miss Johnson. She was very kind and friendly. She showed me around the classroom and introduced me to my new classmates. Everyone was welcoming and I made some new friends quickly.

We started with reading time. I love reading stories about adventures and magical places. After that, we had math class where we learned about numbers and counting. 

During lunch break, I played with my new friends in the playground. We had so much fun on the swings and slides. 

In the afternoon, we had art class. We drew pictures of our families and colored them with bright crayons. I drew my mom, dad, and my little sister.

When school finished, my mom was waiting for me at the gate. I told her all about my wonderful first day. I can't wait to go back tomorrow and learn more new things!`;
